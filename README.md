# SimpleSpreadSheet
In this challenge you must build a simple spreadsheet application using JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and
HTML.
The purpose of this challenge is to determine your ability to follow instructions as well as evaluate your
programming skills.

Expected Level of Effort by Seniority
Junior Level – One week
Senior Level – 2 days
Staff Level+ – 1 day or same day
# Features you must develop
Two text inputs, one labeled “Rows” and one labeled ”Columns” and a “Generate”
button
If you specify the Rows and Columns values and submit, it will generate a spreadsheet table at
that size
Cells should be uniform in size and never change size. If values inside cells are too big, show
ellipses.
Show Column and Row labels (Alpha characters for columns, numbers for rows)
If you click on a cell once, you select that cell. It should have an outline color to
indicate selection
If you hit the delete key while a cell is highlighted, it erases the value in that cell
If you press the Enter key, the selection should move one row down. Shift+Enter moves
selection one row up
If you press the Tab

If you double-click on a cell, it becomes a text input, you can enter in any value
Text input should be styled to fit within cell and to look like a cell to give the appearance of
editing-in-place
Hitting Enter or Tab key submits value
Hitting ESC key cancels
Clicking outside of cell submits value
When value is submitted, the text input disappears and the value displays in the cell
Below your table add a textarea and two buttons: “EXPORT” and “IMPORT”
“EXPORT” button exports the data in the table as JSON into the textarea
“IMPORT” button imports JSON from the text area
Create your own data format for this
Styling the table
Each cell should have a border of 1px set to the color #999999
Every EVEN row should have a #FFFFFF background color
Every ODD row should have a #EEEEEE background color
Row and Column labels should have a background color of #CCCCCC
All text should be black
# Programming Rules and Limitations
You may only use JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the jQuery library.
No other plugins, libraries, or frameworks allowed.
You must write everything yourself. Do not copy solutions from online or get help from someone
else.
Work inside a folder. Inside should be:
an index.html file, where you'll put your HTML
a spreadsheet.js file, where you'll put your code
a spreadsheet.css file, where you'll put your CSS
jquery.min.js

How your table is generated
How dynamic is your code
How efficient is your spreadsheet
How well do you use CSS to style your spreadsheet
How good is the User Experience
How good are your programming skills
How well do you know Mouse and keyboard events
How familiar are you with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
How you handle your data model
How original is your code
